# Azure Integration Services Deployment Scripts (bicep)
These scripts are meant to help you get kickstarted with Azure deployments for Azure Integration Services. The scripts are written in **Bicep**. Not in the first place because I am a gymrat. I could've used Terraform, but considering the learning curve and the preserving the state is very important there (you can seriously mess things up if it is not done correctly), I have gone for Bicep. Also considering Bicep mostly aligns with Microsoft's Azure Resource Manager API.
